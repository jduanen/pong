# Midway Pong Board

Original Pong video game board restoration

I bought this board at hamfest in 1977 and scavanged several TTL parts and sockets off of it to use in other projects (as I was poor undergrad, and I had a really bad soldering iron then and lacked any semblance of soldering skill, so I lifted some traces and gouged the board in spots).

I recently replaced the sockets and repaired traces and am in the process of restoring it and building an enclosure for it. I plan on making some modifications to the board, including the one that improves the sync signals to be closer to the actual NTSC specs. [TODO add Ref]
